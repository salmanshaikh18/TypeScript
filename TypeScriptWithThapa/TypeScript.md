## TypeScript

`TypeScript` is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to enhance JavaScript development. It was developed by Microsoft on Oct 1, 2012, and is now an open-source project with a large community of contributors.

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.

TypeScript catches errors at compile time instead of runtime, which makes dubugging and reduces the likelihood of bugs in production.
